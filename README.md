# Treys-Poem
The bus arrives at five till eight.
If I don't rush, I'm always late.
The school bus smells 
of lunch and glue.
And while we ride,
there's lots to do.
We talk a lot 
and throw some hats.
We play keep away
and other things like that.
The driver yells,
but we don't mind.
Beneath it all
we know she's kind.
There's lots of noise;
we laugh and shout.
We get to school.
We all pile out.
We go to class, to lunch, 
and then
it's time to ride the bus again.
The bus time's fun.
I think it's cool.
It's my favorite
part of school.
