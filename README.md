# Treys-Poem
The bus arrives at five till eight.
If I don't rush, I'm always late.
The school bus smells 
of lunch and glue.
And while we ride,
there's lots to do.
We talk a lot 
and throw some hats,
play keep away
and things like that.
The driver yells,
but we don't mind.
Beneath it all
we know she's kind.
There's lots of noise;
we laugh and shout.
We get to school.
We all pile out.
We go to class, to lunch,
